# GitHub User Creation Date Fetcher (Bootstrap + GitHub Pages)

A small, modern static website that exposes a Bootstrap-based page to fetch a GitHub username and display the account creation date in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD UTC). The page supports an optional ?token= query parameter to authenticate requests to the GitHub API and increase rate limits when needed.

## Project summary
- Lightweight, dependency-free (aside from Bootstrap CDN) static site ready for GitHub Pages.
- Clean separation of concerns with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a small set of files.
- Serverless in nature â€“ performs client-side fetches directly to the GitHub REST API.

## Files included
- index.html: The homepage with a Bootstrap layout and the form that fetches data.
- assets/css/styles.css: Minimal styling to improve aesthetics and readability.
- assets/js/main.js: Core logic to resolve the dynamic form id, extract the username, read an optional token from the URL, call the GitHub API, and render the creation date as YYYY-MM-DD UTC in #github-created-at.
- README.md: This file.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub. You can choose a user site (username.github.io) or a project site (username.github.io/repo).
   - For a user site, the repository name must be username.github.io and you can serve from the repository root.
   - For a project site, the repository name can be anything and you enable Pages to serve from the main (or gh-pages) branch.
2. Push the repository contents (index.html, assets/, README.md, etc.) to your chosen repository.
3. In GitHub, open Settings > Pages.
   - Source: Main branch (root) for a project site, or your preferred branch/folder as needed.
   - Save and wait a few moments for GitHub to publish the site.
4. Visit the published URL (e.g., https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/).

Optional: If you want to increase GitHub API rate limits, provide a personal access token via a query parameter: ?token=YOUR_TOKEN
- Example: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/?token=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- The token is sent as an Authorization: token <token> header to the API call.

## How to use
- Enter any GitHub username (e.g., octocat) in the input field and click Fetch User.
- The page will call the GitHub REST API and display the account creation date in UTC, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD UTC, inside the badge labeled Created at.
- If a token is provided, requests will be authenticated to improve rate limits.

## Key code/files and their purpose
- index.html: Structure, Bootstrap layout, and the placeholder form with id github-user-PLACEHOLDER. The script renames it to a seed-based id at runtime to ensure uniqueness.
- assets/css/styles.css: Visual styling for a clean, modern look that remains responsive across devices.
- assets/js/main.js: Logic to:
  - Generate a seed-based dynamic form id (github-user-<seed>).
  - Read the user input and the optional ?token= query parameter.
  - Fetch data from https://api.github.com/users/{username} with optional Authorization header.
  - Display the creation date as YYYY-MM-DD UTC in #github-created-at.
- README.md: Documentation, setup, usage, and licensing.
